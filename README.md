# Portfolio v4.0 (2017)

The 2017 rendition of my official portfolio.

Feel free to use the code however you want (as long as you don't straight rip it -- or whatever, you do you).

***

**To Do:**

* Priority:
    * Add lazy loading for images.
        * Now that the overflow clipping "issue" is fixed this can be revisited! :D
    * Go back and clean up CSS rules.
    
* Secondary:
    * Build the subpage skeleton.
    * Utilize InstaClick.js or similar + animations.
    * Setup CloudFront and revisit using <img> tags for the project tiles rather than background images. This is done to further improve load times with more optimized image sizes and also integrate a better (see: fancier) method of lazy loading images.
    * Build a 404 page whenever I get around to it.
    * Place the website onto CraftCMS (for no good reason other than xp).
