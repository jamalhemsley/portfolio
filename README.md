# Portfolio

The official repository for [my portfolio](https://digitalheat.co). Feel free to take a look through the code.

## Getting Started

This site is built with Gatsby. To develop it locally, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12+ and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start/) installed.

### Local Development

To run/develop this project locally, you'll need to clone this repository to your local development environment. Then, navigate to the project folder in a terminal and type `gatsby develop`. That's it!

## To Do

Things to (eventually) get around to doing:

-   Build out case studies.
-   Clean up repetitive CSS.
-   Break down components into utilities that can be reused without additional code.
