# Portfolio v4.0 (2017)

The 2017 rendition of my official portfolio.

Feel free to use the code however you want (as long as you don't straight rip it -- or whatever, you do you).

***

**To Do:**

* ~~Fix anchor hover animations.~~ Not broken, but linear-gradients can't be animated in that fashion. :(
* Add in lazy loading of images to further improve load times.
* Build the subpage skeleton.
* Integrate InstaClick.js.
* *N/E* Add in projects so it's finally presentable.
* Bake in page switching animations for that there SPA feel.
* Setup CloudFront and revisit using <img> tags for the project tiles rather than background images. This is done to further improve load times with more optimized image sizes and also integrate a better (see: fancier) method of lazy loading images.
* Build a 404 page whenever I get around to it.
* Place the website onto CraftCMS (for no good reason other than xp).
